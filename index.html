      <h1>Scarface</h1>
      <p>
        In 1980, Cuban refugee and ex-convict Antonio "Tony" Montana arrives in
        Miami, Florida, as part of the Mariel boatlift, where he is sent to a
        refugee camp with his best friends, Manny Ribera, Angel and Chi-Chi. The
        four are released and given green cards in exchange for murdering a
        former Cuban general at the request of Miami drug dealer Frank Lopez.
        They become dishwashers in a diner, but a disgusted Tony proclaims that
        he is meant for bigger things. Frank's right-hand man, Omar Suarez,
        sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers, but the deal
        goes bad. Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, while Manny and Chi-Chi
        rescue Tony and kill the Colombians. Suspecting that Omar set them up,
        Tony and Manny insist on personally delivering the recovered drugs and
        money to Frank. During their meeting, Tony is attracted to Frank's
        trophy wife, Elvira Hancock. Frank hires and befriends Tony and Manny.
        Months later, Tony is reunited with his mother Georgina and younger
        sister Gina, of whom he is fiercely protective. Disgusted by his life of
        crime, Georgina throws Tony out. Manny is attracted to Gina, but Tony
        tells him to stay away from her.
